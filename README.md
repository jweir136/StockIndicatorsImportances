# StockIndicatorsImportances
This is a simple experiment designed to uncover which technical indicators are the most important.

  An issue that most traders have been wondering for a long time is, which indicators in technical anaylsis matter the most?  Which ones carry very little importance?  And, which ones are not importance at all, and can be ignored?  This experiement sets out to uncover the answer to all of these questions.
  This script uses the python "stockstats" module to compute some of the most commonly used indicators, including SMA, EMA, RSI, and VR.  Using scikit-learn's RandomForest model, the importance of each of these indicators is computed, and then graphed.
